                <h2>GDP Per Capita Across South East Asia</h2>
                <div class="p1">
                    South East Asia is a region of diverse economies with countries like Singapore boasting a high 
                    GDP per capita due to its developed and diversified economy, while others like Myanmar have a 
                    lower GDP per capita reflecting a less developed economic status. For instance, as of 2023, 
                    Singapore has a projected GDP per capita of around $63,987, while Myanmar's GDP per capita is 
                    about $1,408. This disparity is a reflection of the different stages of economic development 
                    and the various challenges and opportunities faced by these countries.

                <h2>Unemployment Rate Across South East Asia</h2>
                <div class="p1">
                    This bar graph highlights that a high GDP per capita does not always correlate with a low 
                    unemployment rate, as exemplified by Brunei. This visualization underscores the varied economic 
                    and labor market conditions in the region, encouraging a deeper analysis beyond GDP figures to 
                    understand unemployment rates in different South East Asian countries.

                <h2>GDP Breakdown by Sector</h2>
                <div class="p1">
                    The treemap visualization in the third section provides a detailed breakdown of GDP by sectors 
                    (Agriculture, Industry, and Services) across various South East Asian countries, showcasing a 
                    diverse range of economic structures. For instance, Singapore significantly leans towards the 
                    service sector, contributing to 75.2% of its GDP, while its agricultural sector is non-existent. 
                    On the other hand, countries like Cambodia and Laos have a notable portion of their GDP coming 
                    from agriculture. Most countries exhibit a balanced contribution from both the Industry and 
                    Services sectors, indicative of a transition towards modern economic structures. The 
                    visualization also hints at varying economic transitions within these countries, with a higher 
                    percentage of GDP from services and industry sectors possibly indicating a move towards a more 
                    modernized economy.

                <h2>How does the Economy affect Health?</h2>
                <div class="p1">
                    The bubble plot in the last section elucidates the relationship between the density of physicians 
                    per thousand people and the life expectancy across different South East Asian countries, with the 
                    population size represented by the size of the bubbles. A higher density of physicians generally 
                    correlates with a higher life expectancy, indicating better healthcare accessibility and standards. 
                    For instance, Singapore, with a higher physician density of 2.29 per thousand, showcases a 
                    remarkable life expectancy of 83.1 years. However, the varying bubble sizes elucidate the 
                    demographic diversity of the region, which is a crucial factor impacting healthcare systems and 
                    policy formulation. Moreover, the size of the bubbles portrays the population size, with countries 
                    like Indonesia and the Philippines having noticeably larger bubbles, indicating their substantial 
                    population. Interestingly, the visualization also hints at the discrepancy in healthcare resources 
                    among populous countries. For instance, despite its large population, the physician density in 
                    Indonesia stands at 0.43 per thousand, which is significantly lower compared to Singapore. The 
                    contrast in physician density and life expectancy between densely populated and less populated 
                    countries like Brunei, reflects the varying healthcare challenges and resource allocation 
                    strategies across the region.
